    <h1>History</h1>
    <h2>Development</h2>
    Photograph of Tim Berners-Lee in April 2009 Tim Berners-Lee in April 2009 In
    1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and
    prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share
    documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based
    hypertext system.[3] Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and
    server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems
    engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but
    the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes of 1990,
    Berners-Lee listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used"; an
    encyclopedia is the first entry.[4] The first publicly available description
    of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags",[5] first mentioned on the
    Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991.[6][7] It describes 18 elements
    comprising the initial, relatively simple design of HTML. Except for the
    hyperlink tag, these were strongly influenced by SGMLguid, an in-house
    Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)-based documentation format at
    CERN. Eleven of these elements still exist in HTML 4.[8]
